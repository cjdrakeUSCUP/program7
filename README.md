# program7

Unfortunately I did not commit enough time to this assignment due to finals coming up soon and just having a lot of work due this week which sucks because this is my favorite assignment as I will probably work with it during holiday break. I could not even get the sample code to work properly so all code I added unfortunately may not even work but I still gave what I could a shot.

I added pause and unpause functions that will stop the game and pop up a box that will have either quit or continue on it. Choosing quit will exit the game while continue will pick up where it left off. 

My code would not pull up anything from the pygame directory (even though I installed it properly and would even play the sounds for a second) but I did try to work around it. I changed the whiff sound I zipped to a different audio that says "missed it by that much". 

I attempted adding a scoreboard but unfortunately not being able to see what it did the program I left it out. I had hit counts and put it with the if statement in line 180 to count each punch that lands and put miss with the else statement. (unsure if those are the best places but I believed thats where they would go). With the extra space I gave the program changing (I beliecve) screen or pygame.display to 800 by 400. I was going to put hits in bottom left and misses in bottom right.

I also was going to add a bull and donkey but without knowing how things react I found it impossible to implement.

I apologize for the lack of work in this assignment. Wanting to be a game developer really made me excited for this assignment which is the first time I've been genuinely excited about coding. I will definetly be working with pygames more in my free time during the break! Thanks for class, Even though I struggled here and there, I will take the lessons I've learned and improve my coding abilities!
